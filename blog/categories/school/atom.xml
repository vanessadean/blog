    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Everything is an object in Ruby</h2>

<p>Even methods act like objects. We iterated over a method in a lab this week, e.g. <code>assign_rooms(speakers).each</code> and I had never seen that before. A tiny explosion happened in my brain. When the dust settled I realized that I was actually just iterating over the return value, an array, and that totally makes sense.</p>

<h2>Error messages are there to help</h2>

<p>Read all of the words. Pay attention to what they are saying. Your computer is trying to tell you something.</p>

<h2>Specs are for following</h2>

<p>I like to do things myyyyyy waaaaaaay, but nothing is created in a vacuum. I need to learn how to follow directions and build the best possible program following the set specifications.</p>

<h2>Asking questions is awesome</h2>

<p>I think I understand everything and most of the time I understand nothing. To fix this I&rsquo;ve become that annoying guy at the table constantly asking questions. That&rsquo;s okay though because&hellip;</p>

<h2>We are here to help each other</h2>

<p>So many people have generously and patiently helped me this week. Paying it forward is the right thing to do and it&rsquo;s the best way to figure out whether or not you actually understand something.</p>

<h2>Cold brew coffee is key</h2>

<ol>
<li>Let French press steep in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>Pour coffee straight into mouth the next morning.</li>
</ol>


<h2>It&rsquo;s time to embrace snacking</h2>

<p>```ruby
def afternoon_snack_attack
  if block_given? #snack_given?</p>

<pre><code>yield("M&amp;Ms")
yield("Cheezits")
yield("Swedish Fish")
":] :) :D"
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>"(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>afternoon_snack_attack { |snack| puts &ldquo;eating #{snack} nom nom nom&rdquo;  }
```</p>
