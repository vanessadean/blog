    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our seventh week at Flatiron School just flew by and we&rsquo;ve started studying JavaScript (on top of Rails). So much information is getting crammed into my brain that I&rsquo;m a little worried about losing track of the basics. I know that there are a ton of helpful resources out there, but some of my favorites are the blog posts that my fellow students have written. We are all roughly in the same place as noobies so their perspectives and insights are especially helpful. I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of my favorite posts in my bookmarks folder but figured it would be a lot easier to keep a few compiled here. Without further ado&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re at the halfway point at the Flatiron School and it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about jobs. I was curious about non-profit and social enterprise companies in the tech industry and here is a roundup of a few that I found during my research:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">Donor&rsquo;s Choose</a>
Online charity organization that helps public school teachers raise funds for class projects. Based in New York.</p>

<p><a href="http://benetech.org/">Benetech</a>
A non-profit dedicated to developing technology focused on social benefits. Based in San Francisco.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idealist.org/">idealist</a>
Networking site for non-profits. Based in New York.</p>

<p><a href="http://www1.networkforgood.org/">Network for Good</a>
Provides online fundraising tools to help non-profits connect with donors. Based in DC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdrise.com">CrowdRise</a>
An online fundraising site for individuals who want to raise funds for the causes that they care about.</p>

<p><a href="www.catchafire.org">Catchafire</a>
Matches professionals who
want to volunteer their skills with
non-profits who need their help. Based in New York.</p>

<p>No matter where I end up working, I definitely plan to give back through volunteering. Here are a couple of organizations in New York that I&rsquo;d like to investigate a little further:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a>
Connects technology professionals with high school teachers to provide computer science classes in public schools.</p>

<p><a href="http://nycgenerationtech.com/">NYC Generation Tech</a>
An NYC non-profit dedicated to teaching young people technology and entrepreneurship skills.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a ton of other organizations out there and I&rsquo;m going to keep doing research.</p>

    <link href="http://vanessadean.github.io/blog/2014/06/25/yaml-time/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-25T13:56:38-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vanessadean.github.io/blog/2014/06/25/yaml-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is YAML?</h2>

<p>To quote the <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">official YAML site</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>YAML helps humans store and transmit data via text, and to convey a specific structure and organization of that data, in a way that both humans and machines can understand. The <a href="http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html">YAML Cookbook for Ruby</a> is a great resource for learning ruby/YAML syntax and here are a few simple examples from the site to illustrate how YAML translates to ruby and vice versa:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby array
<code>ruby
['apple', 'banana', 'carrot']
</code></li>
<li>Yaml array
```</li>
<li>apple</li>
<li>banana</li>
<li><p>carrot
```</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby hash
<code>ruby
{ 'foo' =&gt; 'whatever', 'bar' =&gt; 'stuff' }
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Yaml hash
<code>
foo: whatever
bar: stuff
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Ruby array/hash combo
<code>ruby
{ 'foo' =&gt; 'whatever', 'bar' =&gt; [ 'uno', 'dos' ] }
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Yaml array/hash combo
```
foo: whatever
bar:</p></li>
<li>uno</li>
<li>dos
```

<h2>Ok, I get it. But how do I use YAML?</h2></li>
</ul>


<p>Here are instructions straight from the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html">Ruby documentation</a>:</p>

<p>```
require &lsquo;yaml&rsquo; # STEP ONE, REQUIRE YAML!</p>

<h1>Parse a YAML string</h1>

<p>YAML.load(&ldquo;&mdash;&ndash; foo&rdquo;) #=> &ldquo;foo&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Emit some YAML</h1>

<p>YAML.dump(&ldquo;foo&rdquo;)     # => &ldquo;&mdash;&ndash; foo\n&hellip;\n&rdquo;
{ :a => &lsquo;b&rsquo;}.to_yaml  # => &ldquo;&mdash;&ndash;\n:a: b\n&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>I did not find this particularly helpful. I wanted to load a .yml file (not parse a random YAML string), but I also made things harder on myself because I refused to believe that it was that simple. YAML is just plain ol' text that tells you everything you need to know about the data and its structure. Once I tracked down a method for parsing a .yml file (thanks <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877004/how-do-i-parse-a-yaml-file">StackOverflow</a>!) and did a little something like this</p>

<p><code>ruby
require 'yaml'
thing = YAML.load_file('some.yml')
puts thing.inspect
</code></p>

<p>to translate my YAML to ruby, the next steps for using my data became clearer. Here are some details to help illustrate.</p>

<p>I was working on a lab that consisted of building a movie database. A seed_data.yml file with the following data was provided:</p>

<h2>```</h2>

<p>movies:
&ndash; !ruby/object:Movie
  attributes:</p>

<pre><code>title: Wargames
release_date: 1983
director: John Badham
lead: Matthew Broderick
in_theaters: false
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>!ruby/object:Movie
attributes:
  title: The Sting
  release_date: 1973
  director: George Roy Hill
  lead: Paul Newman
  in_theaters: false
  id:</li>
<li>!ruby/object:Movie
attributes:
  title: Nebraska
  release_date: 2013
  director: Alexander Payne
  lead: Bruce Dern
  in_theaters: true
```</li>
</ul>


<p>This example is a little more complex than the previous ones provided and shows the true power of YAML. The <code>!ruby/object:Movie</code> lines in the YAML file are delimiting ruby objects with the signified attributes. Parsing this data using <code>YAML.load_file()</code> produces this movies hash in ruby:</p>

<p><code>
{"movies"=&gt;
  [#&lt;Movie id: nil, title: "Wargames", release_date: 1983, director: "John Badham", lead: "Matthew Broderick", in_theaters: false&gt;,
   #&lt;Movie id: nil, title: "The Sting", release_date: 1973, director: "George Roy Hill", lead: "Paul Newman", in_theaters: false&gt;,
   #&lt;Movie id: nil, title: "Nebraska", release_date: 2013, director: "Alexander Payne", lead: "Bruce Dern", in_theaters: true&gt;,
   #&lt;Movie id: nil, title: "Muppets Most Wanted", release_date: 2014, director: "James Bobin", lead: "Tom Hiddleston", in_theaters: true&gt;,
   #&lt;Movie id: nil, title: "Zero Dark Thirty", release_date: 2012, director: "Kathryn Bigelow", lead: "Jessica Chastain", in_theaters: false&gt;]}
</code></p>

<p>Which means that the text in the .yml file can be turned into ruby objects and added to my movies database with four lines of code:</p>

<p><code>ruby
YAML.load_file('seed_data.yml')['movies'].each do |movie|
  Movie.create(movie.attributes)
  movie.save
end
</code></p>

<p>BOOM!</p>

    <link href="http://vanessadean.github.io/blog/2014/06/19/sql-sux-and-ruby-rulz/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-19T22:14:51-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vanessadean.github.io/blog/2014/06/19/sql-sux-and-ruby-rulz</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week at the Flatiron School we started discussing databases and models and studying SQL. This is a big step towards the holy grail of building fully functional web applications, but it’s not much fun. Staring at lifeless SQL commands makes it painfully clear why learning a flexible and expressive language like ruby is so much more fun. When you write in ruby you have plenty of opportunities to share your own style and to provide a window into the thought process behind your solution. In that spirit, I’d like to share a few examples from a simple lab we recently completed.</p>

<p>The purpose of this lab was to confirm the identity of a triangle given the length of its sides &ndash; equilateral (all sides of equal length), isosceles (two sides equal) or scalene (no sides equal).</p>

<p>Here is my code:
```ruby
  def kind</p>

<pre><code>if !valid_triangle? # checks to see if valid values have been submitted for the length of each side
  raise TriangleError # raises an error if invalid 
else
  if side1 == side2 # checks for equality for first two sides 
    if side2 == side3 # checks if the third side is also equal
      :equilateral
    else
      :isosceles
    end
  elsif side2 == side3 || side1 == side3 #otherwise checks whether sides two and three are equal
    :isosceles
  else
    :scalene
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def valid_triangle?</p>

<pre><code>return false if (side1 + side2) &lt;= side3 || (side1 + side3) &lt;= side2 || (side2 + side3) &lt;= side1 
# it is not possible to have a triangle with one side longer than the sum of the other two sides

[side1, side2, side3].each do |side| # it is not possible for the length of a side to be zero or a negative number
  return false if side &lt;= 0 
end 
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```
This is begging to be refactored, especially the awkward use of !valid_triangle?, but it&rsquo;s a representative, unfiltered example of the meandering thought process that I take when solving a problem.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at a more polished solution from <a href="https://github.com/randallreedjr">randallreedjr</a>:
```ruby
  def kind</p>

<pre><code>if valid?
  if sides[0] == sides[1] &amp;&amp; sides[0]== sides[2]
    return :equilateral
  elsif sides[0] == sides[1] || sides[1] == sides[2] || sides[0] == sides[2]
    return :isosceles
  else
    return :scalene
  end
else
  raise TriangleError
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private
   def valid?</p>

<pre><code> sides[0] + sides[1] &gt; sides[2] &amp;&amp; sides[1] + sides[2] &gt; sides[0] &amp;&amp; sides[0] + sides[2] &gt; sides[1]
</code></pre>

<p>   end
```
Here are my favorite things about this code:</p>

<ul>
<li>it does economical testing for each triangle scenario and for the validity test</li>
<li>it is easy to follow</li>
<li>the validity test is in a private method so the user can&rsquo;t hack his way into testing an impossible triangle</li>
</ul>


<p>It is built for business.</p>

<p>For our final example, let&rsquo;s take a look at a solution from <a href="https://github.com/jbarrieault">jbarrieault</a> that is a bit quirkier:
```ruby
  def triangle?</p>

<pre><code>triangle = [side1, side2, side3]

return false if triangle.any? do |side|
  side == nil || side == 0 || side != side.abs
end

triangle.each do |test_side|
  return false if test_side &gt;= triangle.inject(-test_side,:+)
end

return true
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def kind</p>

<pre><code>raise TriangleError unless triangle?
return :equilateral if [side1, side2].all? { |side| side == side3 }
return :isosceles   if side1 == side2 || side2 == side3 || side1 == side3 
return :scalene     if [side1, side2].none? { |side| side == side3}  
</code></pre>

<p>  end
<code>``
Can we talk about</code>triangle.inject(-test_side,:+)`? WTF and FTW. It&rsquo;s testing if one side of the triangle is greater than the sum of the other two sides by seeding the inject method with a negative value for the side that it is testing against and then adding up the lengths of all sides on top of that. It&rsquo;s not particularly easy to follow, but it&rsquo;s fun to read and definitely gives you a sense of the personality behind it. The man behind the madness admits to being seduced by the allure of clever code, something that all ruby nubies must be susceptible to, and writes more about the inherent danger of choosing impressive code over expressive code <a href="http://jbarrieault.github.io/blog/2014/06/19/expressive/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now back to SQL&hellip; :(</p>
